There was a lot to learn and experience this year at
[SIGIR](http://sigir.org/sigir2018/). Ann Arbor is not the most exciting place,
but certain parts of the UMichigan campus has its charm (plus the fireflies).

Here is my [talk](/uploads/profs2018-talk.pdf) at the
Professional Search workshop (which btw, was also a great experience).

Apart from the alignment issues of my pdf presentation (apparently rendering
pdf presentations is still not universally simple), I didn't majestically mess
up. Here is a picture of me trying to perform basic functions like speaking.
